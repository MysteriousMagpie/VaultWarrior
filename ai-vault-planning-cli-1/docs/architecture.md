# Architecture Overview

The AI Vault Planning CLI is designed to facilitate the management and interaction with markdown vaults, leveraging AI capabilities for enhanced productivity. The architecture is modular, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. Below is an overview of the key components and their interactions.

## Core Components

1. **CLI Interface (`cli.py`)**
   - The entry point for the command-line interface, handling user input and dispatching commands.

2. **Configuration Management (`config/loader.py`)**
   - Responsible for loading configuration settings from files, ensuring that the application can be customized based on user preferences.

3. **Command Modules (`commands/*.py`)**
   - Each command (e.g., `init`, `index`, `thread`, `ask`, `chat`, `capture`, `plan`, `doctor`) is implemented in its own module, promoting separation of concerns and ease of testing.

4. **Indexing (`indexing/*.py`)**
   - Contains functionality for crawling markdown files, parsing their content, and creating embeddings for efficient retrieval.

5. **Retrieval System (`retrieval/*.py`)**
   - Manages the storage and ranking of retrieved results, enabling users to quickly access relevant information.

6. **LLM Integration (`llm/*.py`)**
   - Interfaces with language models (e.g., OpenAI) to provide AI-driven responses and interactions.

7. **Planning (`planning/*.py`)**
   - Facilitates the creation of plans and summaries based on user threads, enhancing task management.

8. **Thread Management (`threads/*.py`)**
   - Handles the creation and management of threads, allowing users to organize their thoughts and tasks effectively.

9. **Vault Management (`vault/*.py`)**
   - Manages daily notes and metadata associated with the vault, ensuring that all relevant information is easily accessible.

10. **Utilities (`utils/*.py`)**
    - Provides various utility functions for logging, time management, and file path handling, supporting the overall functionality of the application.

11. **Error Handling (`errors.py`)**
    - Defines custom error classes to manage exceptions and improve user feedback.

## Data Flow

1. The user interacts with the CLI, issuing commands that are parsed and routed to the appropriate command module.
2. Each command module may interact with the configuration loader to retrieve settings and with the indexing and retrieval modules to access or store data.
3. The LLM integration allows for dynamic responses based on user queries, enhancing the interactivity of the CLI.
4. Planning and thread management modules work together to help users organize their tasks and notes effectively.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing incremental indexing and a daemon for real-time updates.
- Adding advanced filtering options for better data retrieval.
- Enhancing error handling and rate limiting for API interactions.
- Abstracting model backends to support multiple AI providers.

This architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, accommodating future features and improvements as the project evolves.
