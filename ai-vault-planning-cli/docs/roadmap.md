# Roadmap for AI Vault Planning CLI

## Future Features and Enhancements

### Short-Term Goals
- Implement incremental indexing with `ai index --watch` to automatically update the index as new markdown files are added or modified.
- Develop a daemon mode (`ai daemon`) to run background tasks for indexing and retrieval.
- Introduce advanced filtering options for indexing and retrieval, including support for frontmatter tags and glob patterns.

### Medium-Term Goals
- Enhance error handling and implement rate limiting to manage API usage effectively.
- Create a model backend abstraction layer to support multiple AI providers beyond OpenAI, allowing for greater flexibility in AI interactions.
- Improve citation enrichment features to provide more context and references in responses.

### Long-Term Goals
- Develop a thread summarization feature that can generate concise summaries of ongoing discussions and plans.
- Implement a write policy enforcement mechanism to ensure that all changes are logged and tracked appropriately.
- Integrate git auto-commit improvements to automatically save changes to the vault, enhancing version control.

### Community and Documentation
- Foster a community around the project for user feedback and contributions.
- Continuously update documentation to reflect new features and usage patterns, ensuring that users have the resources they need to effectively utilize the CLI.

### Performance and Scalability
- Optimize the indexing and retrieval processes for larger vaults to ensure quick response times and efficient resource usage.
- Explore options for distributed indexing and retrieval to support collaborative vaults and shared resources.

This roadmap serves as a guide for the development of the AI Vault Planning CLI, outlining the vision for future enhancements and the steps needed to achieve them.
